# Raspberry Pi Photo Gallery

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a photo gallery application using a Raspberry Pi. The application will allow users to upload, download, and manage photo albums through a clean and responsive interface. The project is divided into several key components:

### Core Components

- **Frontend (React)**: Design a user-friendly interface for photo management.
- **Backend (Django)**: Develop APIs for handling uploads, downloads, user authentication, and album management.

### Server Options

- **Self-Hosted Server**: Use Nginx or Apache to serve the app, with options for dynamic DNS and HTTPS setup.
- **Cloud-Based Hosting**: Utilize free tiers from services like AWS EC2, Heroku, or Railway, with the Raspberry Pi as external storage.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Essential Features**: Develop login/registration pages, file upload/download interfaces, and basic APIs.
2. **Security and Remote Access**: Implement HTTPS, secure authentication, and remote access.
3. **User Management**: Add admin controls and guest access features.

This project will be managed using a GitHub repository, with separate directories for frontend and backend code.
